Demand Forecasting for E-commerce Inventory Management

Inventory management system designed to help businesses optimize their restocking needs based on historical sales data. 
The system consists of several key components:

* Data Collection: This starts by gathering historical sales and inventory data from various sources. This data includes information about product sales, stock levels, and relevant timestamps.

* Data Preprocessing: Once the data is collected, it undergoes thorough preprocessing. This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for machine learning.

* Model Development: Advanced machine learning techniques are used to develop predictive models. These models analyze historical data to forecast future restocking needs for each product in the inventory. For example, the system may predict when to order more units of a particular product to prevent stockouts or overstocking.

* Web Application: The heart of SmartRestock is its user-friendly web interface. The web application allows users to interact with the system effortlessly. Users can input relevant data, such as current inventory levels, and receive restocking recommendations generated by the predictive models.

* Deployment: SmartRestock is deployed on a local server, making it easily accessible to authorized users within the organization. This local deployment ensures data security and privacy.
